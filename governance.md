## The Project

## Governance

### The Steering Council

The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors who have produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. The overall role of the Council is to ensure, through taking input from the Community, the long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community. As The Project draws its strength from representing the Community, it strives to avoid fragmentation of the comminity into separate projects, if possible.

During the everyday project activities, council members participate in all discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members do not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the Council. However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of their contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and Services that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations. In particular, the Council may:

* Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the project.
* Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
* Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process and merging pull requests.
* Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.

Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on an issue in a reasonable time frame.

Outcomes and decisions should be clearly communicated to the community. This can take three different forms: 

* New challenges for Pangeo will be detailed as a GitHub issue for the community to discuss.
* Resolved technical deadlocks will result in an explanation on the relevant issue and/or closure of the relevant pull request.
* Other decisions will be detailed as a narrative blog post.

#### Council Membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a Project Contributor who has produced
contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least six months. Potential Council Members 
are nominated by existing Council members and voted upon by the existing Council after asking if the potential Member is 
interested and willing to serve in that capacity. The Council will be initially formed from the set of existing most active
Project Contributors as of August, 2018.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a comprehensive view of their contributions. This
will include but is not limited to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation, community 
help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like
“100 commits in this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than the project’s overall
well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we
explicitly do not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be evaluated.

If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of one year, they will be considered for removal from the
Council. Before removal, inactive Member will be approached by the a council member to see if they plan on returning to active
participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council vote. If they plan on returning to active participation
soon, they will be given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active participation within that time period they
will be removed by vote of the Council without further grace period. All former Council members can be considered for 
membership again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor. Retired Council members will be listed on the
project website, acknowledging the period during which they were active in the Council.

#### Conflict of Interest

It is expected that Council Members will be employed at a wide range of companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of interests include, but are not limited to:

* Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work, outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
* Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially leak into their work with the Project.
* An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.

All members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue.

## Institutional Partners and Funding

The Steering Council is the primary leadership for the project. No outside institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own, control, usurp or influence the project other than by participating in the Project as Contributors and Council Members. However, because institutions are the primary funding mechanism for the project, it is important to formally acknowledge institutional participation in the project. These are Institutional Partners.

An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an Institutional Partner. Likewise, an Institutional Council Member is any Project Steering Council Member who contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an Institutional Partner.

With these definitions, an Institutional Partner is any recognized legal entity anywhere in the world that employs at least one Institutional Contributor or Institutional Council Member. Institutional Partners can be for-profit or non-profit entities.

Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by employing individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part of their official duties. To state this another way, the only way for an Institutional Partner to influence the project is by actively contributing to the open development of the project, on equal terms with any other member of the community of Contributors and Council Members. Merely using Project Software or Services in an institutional context does not allow an entity to become an Institutional Partner. Financial gifts do not enable an entity to become an Institutional Partner. Once an institution becomes eligible for Institutional Partnership, the Steering Council must nominate and approve the Partnership.

If an existing Institutional Partner no longer has a contributing employee, they will be given a one-year grace period for other employees to begin contributing.

An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on The Project through any legal means, though the Institutional Partner is obliged to inform the Steering Council of any such decisions. This could involve a non-profit organization raising money from private foundations and donors or a for-profit company building proprietary products and services that leverage Project Software and Services. Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to work on The Project is called Institutional Funding. However, no funding obtained by an Institutional Partner can override the decisions of the Steering Council. If a Partner has funding to do Project work and the Council decides to not pursue that work as a project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their own. However, in this situation, that part of the Partner’s work will not be under the Project umbrella.

## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull request to The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at https://github.com/pangeo-data/governance. The pull request is then refined in response to public comment and review, with the goal being consensus in the community. The period for open comment will last in proportional to the complexity of the changes; major changes will be open for comment for no less than two weeks. After this open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to the Steering Council that the changes be ratified and the pull request merged (accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed without merging (rejecting the proposed changes). The Member should state the final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance or rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of the Steering Council must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be positive to carry out the proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer).
