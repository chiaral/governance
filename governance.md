## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull request to The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at https://github.com/pangeo-data/governance. The pull request is then refined in response to public comment and review, with the goal being consensus in the community. After this open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to the Steering Council that the changes be ratified and the pull request merged (accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed without merging (rejecting the proposed changes). The Member should state the final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance or rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of the Steering Council must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be positive to carry out the proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer).
