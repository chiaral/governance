### The Steering Council

#### Council Membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a Project Contributor who has produced
contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least six months. Potential Council Members 
are nominated by existing Council members and voted upon by the existing Council after asking if the potential Member is 
interested and willing to serve in that capacity. The Council will be initially formed from the set of existing most active
Project Contributors as of August, 2018.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a comprehensive view of their contributions. This
will include but is not limited to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation, community 
help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like
“100 commits in this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than the project’s overall
well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we
explicitly do not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be evaluated.

If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of one year, they will be considered for removal from the
Council. Before removal, inactive Member will be approached by the a council member to see if they plan on returning to active
participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council vote. If they plan on returning to active participation
soon, they will be given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active participation within that time period they
will be removed by vote of the Council without further grace period. All former Council members can be considered for 
membership again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor. Retired Council members will be listed on the
project website, acknowledging the period during which they were active in the Council.
