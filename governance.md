## The Project

The Pangeo Project (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal of The Project is to develop open source software and related technology for the analysis of large scientific datasets. The Project endeavors to extend the broader scientific software ecosystem.
The Software developed by The Project is released under the BSD (or similar) open source license, developed openly and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the Pangeo-data GitHub organization. Examples of Project Software include the tools and configurations related to the deployment of computational infrastructure. The Services run by the Project consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted under the pangeo.io or pangeo-data.org domains. Examples of Project Services include the Pangeo website (https://pangeo.org and https://pangeo.io), Pangeo-JupyterHub deployments (https://pangeo.pydata.org and https://pangeo.informaticslab.co.uk), and the Pangeo-Binder (https://binder.pangeo.io).

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code, documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on GitHub, Gitter chat rooms and mailing lists. The foundation of Project participation is openness and transparency.

Here is a list of the current Contributors to the main Pangeo repository:

There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories of the Pangeo Project.

The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project. Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible.
